# About
My first JavaScript app is a to-do application that empowers users to efficiently manage their tasks. With this app, users can create multiple lists of tasks, helping them organize their responsibilities and prioritize their work. They can easily add new tasks to any list, specifying relevant details such as task name, due date, and additional notes.
